# Custom DSi Virtual Console
**STILL VERY INCOMPLETE**
Nintendo never released an official Virtual Console on the DSi, which means that the platform wasn't made portable until 2011 when it was released for the 3DS. But it's about to change.

A group of DS homebrew developers and I are working together to make forks off existing emulators for DS, resulting in a brand new custom DSi Virtual Console with restore points, suspend points, custom settings and a brand-new official looking interface. This new DSi VC will be made for use with HiyaCFW and RocketLauncher.
